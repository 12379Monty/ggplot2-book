- p.2 : Shouldn't ideally the order of the bullets representing steps in
 the GOG data flow be respected ? I remember scales should e.g. be
 computed before the statistics as scale transformations are often
 conducted in order to meet distributional assumptions for the Statistics
 step. If you would prefer the order to stay as it is, then maybe some
 diagram representing the flow of the layered GOG might be added.
 (Actually even if the order would be changed, I still think such a diagram
 might be enlightening for people that are less familiar with Wilkinson (2005)
 or the concept of a grammar of graphics in general.
