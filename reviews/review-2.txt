The book is based on what will clearly be a leading if not the leading
statistics graphics model.  It has a chance to be highly influential and
widely read.  The success of the book will depend on its utility,
understandability, and on having a very large number of graphics
examples.  The author might even consider showing several of the
examples in multiple stages as layers are added to the graph.

I hazard to guess that 90% of the audience of the book will be highly
confused by the "2" in "ggplot2".  I urge the author to rename the
package "ggplot".

Make sure that adequate attention is paid to creating pdf files with
minimal wasted space that are publication quality.

Here are particular recommendations and errors in the chapters that
were sent.

Right before section 4.5: There was no %+% in the commands.

Graph just before 4.5.2: Where is displacement shown?

4.5.2 L2 (line 2): an parameter -> a parameter

4.7 L1: entities such as "stats" might better be shown in a different
font.

3 lines before 4.8: the line starting with "tween" has 4 or more typos

5 lines before table 4.4: few differences?

Fig. 6.1: right panel has tip/total instead of tip/total_bill

9 lines above Fig. 6.2: This is not a sentence

Bullet list under section 6.4: Omit periods at end of bullet text

Table 6.2: give some syntax examples.  Also, add cube root.
