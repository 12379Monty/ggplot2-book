Page 43:
geom_XXX(mapping, data, ..., geom, position)
stat_XXX(mapping, data, ..., stat, position)
should be
geom_XXX(mapping, data, ..., stat, position)
stat_XXX(mapping, data, ..., geom, position)

Final example in grid appendix should be
p <- qplot(wt, mpg, data=mtcars, colour=cyl)
grob <- ggplotGrob(p)
grob2 <- geditGrob(grob, gPath("legend.text"), gp=gpar(fontface = "bold"))
grid.newpage()
grid.draw(grob2)

Figure 2.14, "two time series measuring amount of unemployment",
describes the left plot as having percentage on its y axis when it is actually the proportion of people unemployed.

section 6.4.3 "in the color space they."

In figure 3.8 on page 38, the figure label says that small values occur at the bottom of the scales. But in the figure they do not, e.g. 2 is shown at the top and 10 at the bottom.

Appendix B
Caption to Fig B1, something is wrong

Chap 10
p177-8 Interactive zooming would be so much better!

Chap 9
Figs 9.1 and 9.2 are claimed to be the same, but they are not.

The two plots in Fig 9.2 are supposed to have the same predictions, but do not.

Fig 9.5 (right) is not nearly as good as 9.5 (left) for the purpose.  How would you handle lags?  Did you ever see Graham Wills' Diamond Fast for interactive time series graphics?

§9.2.2 Not a great pcp example.  Would prefer examples where the plot tells us something and is chosen for that reason.  What do the pcp's here tell us?

§7.2 p123 "If you using"
p123 "Imagine you have spatial display"
Fig 6.1 p95 "What does it eat?"  There is no legend entry for insecti
p109 No figure numbers
Surely in a good legend, "below" would be below and "above" would be above?
p72 (jittered figures) Fig 5.5 is not nice
p75 Fig 5.9 seems to me misleading, better to stick with the raw data resolution
Or at least say more about what you are trying to achieve (simulating the likely variability)
p79  Shouldn't cities be shown in the righthand plot?
p79 Does the US look like this?! (Figs 5.12, 5.13)
p81 "useful FOR calculating"
From Karl Ove Hufthammer ------------------------------------------
In ~the middle of page 94, one sentence uses the phrase 'and then' twice. I think the first one should be removed.
On page 100, there should be a space between 'Section' and '7.3.3'.
On page 162-163, there are shown four plots; let's call them A, B, C and D.
B should be identical to C, except for the confidence ribbons. However, both the x and y axes differ.
D should be identical to to B (and to C plus confidence limits). But D looks very different. For example, the peak in B and C lies under the other lines in D. And the axes are also slightly different from B.

In the Fig. C.1 caption you have: "Naming scheming of the panel viewports". "naming scheming" sounds weird; you have "naming scheme" on the previous page.
p. 200
I don't know anything about viewports but it seems strange that the upperleft and bottomright panels are both _2_1, should one be _1_2?

Dent Earl --------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm working my way through your Use R! ggplot2 book, which I'm enjoying, and I ran across a typo (maybe?) on page 25. You don't have an errata page so I apologize if I'm the fiftieth person to point this out, but I believe the xlab and ylab are reversed here:
qplot(
+ carat, price, data = dsmall,
+ xlab = "Price ($)", ylab = "Weight (carats)",
+ main = "Price-weight relationship"
)
I stumbled on it by wanting to log the yxais, which we label carats, only to see the xaxis in log, i.e.,
qplot(
+ log(carat), price, data = dsmall,
+ xlab = "Price ($)", ylab = "Weight (carats)",
+ main = "Price-weight relationship"
)

Rob Baer ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Somewhere early, (sorry, no electronic search or me)  The possessive pronoun "its" was rewritten by an editor as "it is"
p100 Figure 6.4 legend.  I think the reference to the left and right graphs is reversed.
p.102 second line from bottom.  Should read ... "depending on where in colour space they are."
p. 116 line 17 reads, "cation (e.g., x~y) ...";  consider instead "cation (e.g., y~x) ...";
p. 135, fig 7.15  Legend suggest third panel has a smooth that fits the original data.  It actually smooths as in panel 2.  This is exactly the way the code on p.134 draws it, though, so I guess we would sa y the legend not the panel is wrong.
p. 152  The code for vp4 and vp5 appears to produce errors.  Note also that the comment for vp5 says bottom left, but the argument says bottom right.

From Stefan Schreiber
p. 101, 2nd bullet:
For 14/10/1979 to be displayed the format should be “%d/%m/%Y”. In the book it looks like a lower case ‘y’.
p. 143, Table 8.1: Theme elements.
It says that the theme elements axis.text.x and axis.text.y  control the axis labels, and axis.title.x and axis.title.y control the tick labels. I believe it is the other way around (also when considering Fig. 6.12: The components of the axes and legend).

From Raymond Balise
 Page 79 assault and murder should be Assault and Murder
 The code for pages 82 and 83 is not included in the book
 page 84 the first code block is missing the code to make the m2 dataset.  I think this is what you did to make m2:
 m2 <- ggplot(movies, aes(x = round(rating), y = log10(votes)))
 page 84 the second code block is missing the code to make the m dataset.  I think this is what you did to make m:
 m <- ggplot(movies, aes(x = year, y = rating))
 page 124 the code for the left panel of the plot is not included in the book.  I got it by tweaking the mpg3 dataset as follows:
 mpg3 <- within(mpg2, {model <- reorder(as.character(model), cty)
                       manufacturer <- reorder(manufacturer, -cty)
 }
                )
 models <- qplot(cty, model, data = mpg3)
 models
 page 125 has a comma where a decimal point belongs:
 xmaj <- c(.3, .5, 1,3, 5) should be xmaj <- c(.3, .5, 1.3, 5)
 While not really a typo... the American spelling of the word colour on the last line of page 125 does not work.

From Carson Sievert:
  First paragraph of scales chapter: should "the range of the range" be "the range of the _scale_"?
