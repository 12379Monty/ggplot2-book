\chapter{Aesthetic specifications}
\label{cha:specifications}

This appendix summarises the various formats that \code{grid} drawing functions take.  Most of this information is available scattered throughout the R documentation.  This appendix brings it all together in one place.

\section{Colour}
\label{sec:colour_spec}

Colours can be specified with:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A {\bf name}, e.g.\ \code{"red"}. The colours are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:colours}, and can be listed in more detail with \f{colours}. The Stower's institute provides a nice printable pdf that lists all colours:  \url{http://research.stowers-institute.org/efg/R/Color/Chart/}.
    
  \item An {\bf rgb specification}, with a string of the form \code{"#RRGGBB"} where each of the pairs \code{RR}, \code{GG}, \code{BB} consist of two hexadecimal digits giving a value in the range \code{00} to \code{FF}.  Partially transparent can be made with \f{alpha}, e.g.\ \code{alpha("red", 0.5)}

  \item An {\bf NA}, for a completely transparent colour.  
\end{itemize}

The functions \f{rgb}, \f{hsv}, \f{hcl} can be used to create colours specified in different colour spaces.

% The \f{diverge_hcl}, \f{sequential_hcl}, \f{rainbow_hcl}, and \f{heat_hcl} functions from the \code{vcd} package provide other ways of generate colours palettes based on perceptually sound principles.

\section{Line type}
\label{sec:line_type_spec}

Line types can be specified with:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A {\bf integer} or {\bf name}: 0=blank, 1=solid, 2=dashed, 3=dotted, 4=dotdash, 5=longdash, 6=twodash), illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:linetype}

  \item The lengths of on/off stretches of line. This is done with a string of an even number (up to eight) of hexadecimal digits which give the lengths in consecutive positions in the string. For example, the string \code{"33"} specifies three units on followed by three off and \code{"3313"} specifies three units on followed by three off followed by one on and finally three off. 
  
  The five standard dash-dot line types described above correspond to 44, 13, 134, 73, and 2262.
\end{itemize} 

Note that \code{NA} is not a valid value for \code{lty}.

\section{Shape}
\label{sec:shape_spec}

Shapes take four types of values:

\begin{itemize}
  \item An {\bf integer} in $[0, 25]$, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:shape}.

  \item A {\bf single character}, to use that character as a plotting symbol.   

  \item A \code{.} to draw the smallest rectangle that is visible (i.e. about one pixel).
  
  \item An {\bf NA}, to draw nothing.
\end{itemize}

While all symbols have a foreground colour, symbols 19--25 also take a background colour (fill). 

\section{Size}
\label{sec:size}

Throughout \ggplot, for text height, point size and line width, size is specified in millimetres.

\section{Justification}
\label{sec:justification_spec}

Justification of a string (or legend) defines the location within the string that is placed at the given position.  There are two values for horizontal and vertical justification.  The values can be:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A {\bf string}: \code{"left"}, \code{"right"}, \code{"centre"}, \code{"center"}, \code{"bottom"}, and \code{"top"}.
  
  \item A {\bf number} between 0 and 1, giving the position within the string (from bottom-left corner).  These values are demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:justification}.
\end{itemize}
