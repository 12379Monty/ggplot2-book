# Preface

I am tremendously grateful for the success of ggplot2. It's one of the most commonly downloaded R packages and has influenced the design of graphics packages for other languages. Personally, ggplot2 has bought me many exciting opportunities to travel the world and meet interesting people. I love hearing how people are using R, and found ggplot2 useful in their work. 

Over five years since the publication of the ggplot2 book.

## Major changes

Ably aided in this endeavour by Carson Sievert.

* Minimised use of `qplot()`. Feedback indicated that this was a crutch that
  just slowed people down.  The first chapter also switches from the diamonds
  data to the mpg dataset, since there it has intersting patterns that are
  more immediately accessible.
  
* All code is shown in the book.

* Focus more on features that time has shown to be most useful. 

* Updated syntax everywhere to be 1.0.0 compatible.

* Data analysis chapter rewritten to use tidyr and dplyr, and to focus on
  the main challenges of using ggplot2 with your own data (not on integrating
  with modelling, which while cool, is less important.)

  
## The future

ggplot2 is now stable, and is unlikely to change much in the future. There will be bug fixes and there may be new geoms, but the majority of functions will stay the same. 

ggplot2 was my second R package (after reshape) and I made many mistakes when designing in. It's also now quite difficult to change because so many people rely on it. Even fixing a bug can cause problems if people have figured out work arounds that fixing the bug breaks. 

The next iteration of ggplot2 is ggvis. ggvis is significantly more ambitious because it aims to provide a grammar of _interactive_ graphics. ggvis is still young, and lacks many of the features of ggplot2 (most notably it currently lacks facetting and has no way to make static graphics), but over the coming years the goal is for ggvis to better than ggplot2 along most axes.

The syntax of ggvis is a little different to ggplot2 - we've made some changes to clarify confusions that many people have when learning. This means you won't be able to trivially convert your ggplot2 plots to ggvis. But if you've mastered ggplot2, you'll find your skills transfer very well to ggvis and once you've struggled with the new syntax it will feel more natural. The important skills you learn when mastering ggplot2 are not the trivialities of specifying a plot with code, but the much harder challenge of thinking about how to turn data into something visual.
